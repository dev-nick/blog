To open this space I want to briefly go though how Liri came to be.

In the second half of 2016, Michael Spencer and I sat down and figured out
whether it was possible to work together and find synergies between
[Papyros][papyros] and [Hawaii][hawaii], given that we had almost identical
goals and we both lacked man power.

We thoroughly analyzed what we had in common and what were the differences,
turns out that we could work out the differences and cherry-pick the best
from the two projects, so the merge began.

After a while we reached out to the Papyros gitter and got other people on
board, especially the Liri Project guys. And that’s when we decided to include
cross-platform apps to the mix and call the whole project Liri.

*Free Software allows you to fork other people’s code and adapt it to your
needs but sometimes compromise is the best option — as long as it enriches
the project.*

We desired to make a nice desktop and apps using new and modern technologies
like QtQuick without mixing it with QtWidgets or any compatibility shortcut
in order to have a consistent, good looking and functional UI.

For that purpose we needed a sound design language with well defined rules.
Material Design is a complete design language made by talented professionals,
its clarity and structure allow us to focus on the code.

Liri officially debuted in January 2017 when we thought there was a solid
groundwork to start from and let people be aware of our initiative.

In future posts I will go into details of what we are doing as well as a
roadmap for this year.
